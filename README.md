## Project Structure

The project follows MVVM architecture aligned with clean architecture principles:

-   **presentation**: Contains the Android application module, including UI components and dependency injection setup.

-   **data**: Handles data sources, such as local database interactions.

-   **domain**: Defines the business logic and use cases.


## Core Libraries

The project leverages several modern Android libraries to streamline development, ensure scalability, and improve maintainability. Below is a list of the main libraries used and their purposes:

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - A fully static and optimized compile-time dependency injection framework for Android.
- [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) - An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling
- [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) -To implement and easy navigation between fragments
- [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) - Bind data to app user interface
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - For local database management
